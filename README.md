> **A free, private, and efficient dead man's switch emailer on GitHub**

*Ensuring your important messages reach the right people when it matters most.*

## üéØ What is this?

A **dead man's switch** that monitors your GitHub activity and automatically sends emails to your chosen recipients if you go silent for too long. This is a digital safety net that ensures important communications reach your loved ones and handles critical matters when you cannot.

### üî• **Why This is the Best Dead Man's Switch Available:**

- **üÜì 100% FREE** - Thanks to GitHub Actions free tier (compared to paid services that cost monthly)
- **üîß NO DEPENDENCIES** - Just fork the repository and configure the variables
- **üîí ULTRA PRIVATE** - Your data never leaves GitHub (can run self-hosted actions for maximum privacy)
- **‚ö° EFFICIENT** - Takes seconds to run, won't impact your GitHub Actions quota
- **üé® FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE** - Write any emails you want, to anyone you want
- **üìÖ FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE** - Decide on how often to check for activity
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING SYSTEM** - Configurable warnings before the final trigger
- **üß™ TESTABLE** - Built-in test mode so you don't accidentally trigger it
- **ü§ñ MANUAL TESTING** - Test anytime with GitHub Actions GUI with workflow dispatch

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Fork This Repository (Private Fork Recommended)

```bash
# Click the "Fork" button and make sure to check "Private repository"
# This ensures your configuration and messages remain confidential
# You can also make a public fork and use only repository secrets and variables in your emails
# You will still get 100% confidental emails
```

### 2. Customize Your Emails

We've provided some template examples in the `emails/` folder to get you started:

- `gf.txt.template` - For your significant other
- `will.txt.template` - For legal/official matters  
- `loan_shark.txt.template` - For special circumstances

**Important:** Any `.txt` file you place in the `emails/` folder will be sent as an email if the switch is triggered. Create as many as you need for different recipients and purposes. Templates will not be sent.

### 3. Set Up Repository Secrets

Go to your forked repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret

**Required Secrets:**
- `MY_EMAIL` - Your email address (Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, Yahoo, Hotmail supported)
- `MY_PASSWORD` - Your email app password (see [email setup guide](#-email-setup-guide))

### 4. Set Up Repository Variables

Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Variables tab ‚Üí New repository variable

**Required Variables:**
- `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` - Hours between required commits (minimum: 24)
- `NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS` - Warning emails before final trigger (recommended: 2)  
- `ARMED` - Set to `true` for live mode, `false` for testing

**Note:** These variables can also be edited directly in the `dms.yaml` workflow file.

**Example Configuration:**
```
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 336    # 2 weeks (recommended)
NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS = 2      # 2 warning emails (recommended)
ARMED = false               # Test mode (change to true when ready)
```

With the recommended settings (2 weeks + 2 warnings), your final emails will be sent after 6 weeks of inactivity. So quick way to calculate the total time until the final emails are sent is `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL * (NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS + 1)`. But you can configure these variables to your liking.

### 5. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up my dead man's switch"
git push
```

**üéâ Done!** Your dead man's switch is now active!

### 6. Sending Heartbeat Commits

To keep the dead man's switch from triggering, you need to commit to the repository at least once every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` hours. The commit message can be anything you want, here are two examples:

```bash
# Example 1.
git commit --allow-empty -m "Heartbeat"
git push
```

```bash
# Example 2.
git commit --allow-empty -m "4 8 15 16 23 42"
git push
```
## üìß Email Template Format

Create `.txt` files in the `emails/` folder. Here are examples from the provided templates:

### Personal Message Example (from gf.txt.template)
```
To: gf@gmail.com
Subject: Oops, I did it again

Hey Babe,

OK, don't freak out. You're reading this probably because I'm dead or I forgot to turn off my dead man's switch again.

Hopefully it's the latter, so just text me saying that I'm a dumbass and that I forgot to turn off my dead man's switch.
If it's the former though, I'm sorry that I'm literally ghosting you. I hope it wasn't one of those accidents like in Final Destination.

My laptop password is ${LAPTOP_PASSWORD}. You know what to do.

Here is also something I want no one but you to know:
${SECRET_MESSAGE_TO_GF}

Please look after our dog, he's a good boy. Also wear pink to my funeral.
See you in another life.

P.S. I love you.
```

### Special Circumstances Example (from loan_shark.txt.template)
```
To: ${LOAN_SHARK_EMAIL}
Subject: I'm a dead man

Hey,

You said I'll be a dead man if I don't pay you back. Well, I hate to break the news but I'm actually a dead man.

You can collect the 5 grand I owe you from my bff ${PERSON_I_HATE_THE_MOST}, he'll be good for it.

Keep the change.
```

### Legal/Official Example (from will.txt.template)
```
To: saul.goodman@shady-law.com
Subject: I'm dead

Hey, I'm dead. I have 200 bucks in my bank account.
I want you to give that and also all my stuff to my girlfriend. You can reach her at ${GF_EMAIL}.

Thank you for your service,
Like you always said: "It's all good, man."
```

### Environment Variable Examples

Add more secrets/variables to customize your templates:

```
To: ${GF_EMAIL}
Subject: ${EMERGENCY_SUBJECT}

Important information is stored in ${SECRET_LOCATION}.
Contact ${IMPORTANT_CONTACT} for assistance.

The password for my accounts is ${BACKUP_PASSWORD}.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Heartbeat Interval
- **Minimum:** 24 hours (due to cron job in GitHub Actions)
- **Recommended:** 336 hours (2 weeks)
- **Maximum:** Whatever timeframe works for your situation

### Warning System
- **0 warnings:** Immediate final emails when deadline missed (if you think people are after you)
- **2 warnings:** Recommended for most users (4 weeks total with 2-week heartbeat)
- **4+ warnings:** If you're really forgetful

### Armed vs Test Mode
- **Test Mode (`ARMED=false`):** Sends emails to you only for testing
- **Armed Mode (`ARMED=true`):** Sends emails to recipients if you are inactive for the amount of time you specify in `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` in combination with `NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS`.

## üîß Email Setup Guide

### Gmail Setup (Recommended)
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
3. Use your Gmail address for `MY_EMAIL`
4. Use the app password (not your regular password) for `MY_PASSWORD`

### Other Providers
**Supported:** Outlook, iCloud, Yahoo, Hotmail

Most providers don't require app passwords, but it's recommended for security. Enable 2FA and generate app passwords where available for best practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security Features

### üîí **Maximum Privacy**
- **Private Repository:** Your configuration stays confidential
- **No External Services:** Everything runs on GitHub's infrastructure
- **Self-Hosted Option:** Run on your own GitHub Actions runner for ultimate privacy
- **No Data Collection:** We don't see or store anything

### üîê **Security Best Practices**
- Uses app passwords (not your main email password)
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Type-safe Python code with full error handling
- Git-based authentication (no API keys stored)

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Custom Schedules
Edit `.github/workflows/dead-mans-switch.yml` to change checking for activity frequency (not to be confused with the heartbeat interval):

```yaml
# Every day at 9 AM UTC (default)
schedule:
  - cron: '0 9 * * *'

# Every Monday at 6 PM UTC  
schedule:
  - cron: '0 18 * * 1'
```

### Environment Variables for Dynamic Content

Add repository secrets/variables for dynamic email content:

```
LAPTOP_PASSWORD=your_password
SECRET_LOCATION=safe_deposit_box_123
BACKUP_CONTACT=trusted_friend@email.com
IMPORTANT_DOCUMENTS=location_details
```

## üéØ Example Scenarios

### The Active Developer
```
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 168   # 1 week (commits regularly)
NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS = 1     # One warning is sufficient
ARMED = true               # Live operation
```

### The Regular User  
```
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 336   # 2 weeks (recommended)
NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS = 2     # Standard warnings (recommended)
ARMED = false              # Testing phase
```

### The Cautious User
```
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 168   # 1 week
NUMBER_OF_WARNINGS = 4     # Multiple chances if forgetful
ARMED = true
```
